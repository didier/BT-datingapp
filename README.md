### How to navigate to your branch, after you cloned it to your computer locally?

```bash
git checkout <branchname>
```

### Once you've made your feature or changes run

```bash
git add <filename> <or> < . (all)>

git commit -m "<message>"

git push -u origin <branchname>
```

### How are the branches named?
- for features use `feat/<branchname>`
- for fixes use `fix/<branchname>`
